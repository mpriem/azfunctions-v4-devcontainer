Dev container for Azure Functions v4

This is a basic VSCode dev container spec for Azure Functions v4. The OOTB template for a dev container in VSCode only supports PowerShell 7.0.x.
I needed PowerShell 7.2 to be able to get the Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules to work properly due to interoperability issues with an old NewtonSoft.Json version that is part of PowerShell 7.0.x.

I hope with this repo to save someone else some time. Enjoy!
